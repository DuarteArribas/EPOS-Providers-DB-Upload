# Fdetect

This program will detect changes in a directory and email them to the specified email.

The following diagram shows the basic paths of the script as an activity model.

## Features

This project contains the following features:

* Detect directory changes;
* Email the directory changes.

## Possible future implementations

Possible future implementations include:

* More verification;
* Better RINEX validation;
* Error handling in case of network failure;
* Encrypt socket connections;
* Prettify the logging system;
* Setup in makefile, according to the config file;
* Encrypt files, such as logging file, config file, etc.

## Installation

Setup the project by installing its dependencies and creating initial directories:

```bash
make setup
```

To change default directories or configurations, edit the `config/appsclone.cfg file`.
    
## Run

To run the server, type:

```bash
make run
```

To run the file handling, type:

```bash
make runSpecial
```

## Testing

To run a specific test, run:

```bash
make test tf=nameOfTestFile
```

The `nameOfTestFile` shall not contain `test_` at the start and shall not end in `.py`; the makefile automatically handles that.

To run a specific test and print the output, run:

```bash
make testPrint tf=nameOfTestFile
```

To run all tests, run:

```bash
make testAll
```

To run all tests and print the output, run:
```bash
make testAllPrint
```
